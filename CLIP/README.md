# CLIP MODEL

I was in deep learning lecture which in mid term there was a project to train CLIP MODEL on some dataset i forget the name of the dataset, i already knew Transformer at that time and was able to implement basic `attn_score = Q @ k.t` so i tried to write most of the core concepts from scratch, but i will be honest the code you see for dataset structuring that was **AI** i was more locked into the main core architecture implementation rather than preprocessing

### Prereq concepts

- pytorch API
- How Attention Works (attn_score -> softmax -> attn_weights just conceptual understanding of it)
- Why do we add positional embeddings stuff!

Initially i trained this model for 5 epochs (computational constraints), before uploading here i might run it on some real dataset to show the actual working rather than just implementation slop
