# Vanilla Transformer Implementation (Demo)

**Friday, Jan 16, 2026, 3:19 AM in the morning, I wanted to finish at least one small model/project today from my list of 22 projects I have in my todo list (reimplementation), so I already vibe coded HiC-coverage-enhancer around 12 at night. I thought I’d have enough time to vibe code a simple Transformer model.** 

This is my first time building an entire thing end-to-end. Before that, I just used to work on specific logic like attention mechanism, self-attention, multi-head attention, positional encoding, etc., so I was super excited when it started showing me AI crap (I haven’t trained it).

I will try to add documentation and plots explanation ASAP.
